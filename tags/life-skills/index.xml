      <description>Things I wish I&amp;rsquo;d known. Learn time management &amp;amp; delayed gratification. This is the number one predictor of success in my experience. Yes going out with your friends is more interesting than working on your assignment; but finishing your assignments in a timely fashion so they aren&amp;rsquo;t all due at once, and then going out with your friends is better. I recommend using Google Calendar or similar alternatives to keep track of your timetable both classes and other activities.</description>
