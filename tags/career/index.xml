      <description>This is a rehash of advice I regularly give undergraduate students at UTS when they ask me what certification they should get.
I recently received responses for an RFQ for a review of our AWS &amp;amp; Azure governance &amp;amp; architecture. Some vendors had heaps of certs for one cloud, but none for the other. Only one had people that were well rounded with both certs and experience in both. Which makes picking the vendor really easy.</description>

      <description>Things I wish I&amp;rsquo;d known. Learn time management &amp;amp; delayed gratification. This is the number one predictor of success in my experience. Yes going out with your friends is more interesting than working on your assignment; but finishing your assignments in a timely fashion so they aren&amp;rsquo;t all due at once, and then going out with your friends is better. I recommend using Google Calendar or similar alternatives to keep track of your timetable both classes and other activities.</description>
