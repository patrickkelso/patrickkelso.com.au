      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last two weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve attended two conferences hosted by organisations based in North America. The experiences I had as an Australian in Sydney were vastly difference. One conference - I&amp;rsquo;m going to refer to it as Conf1 - leveraged technology to create opportunities for community and serendipity. The other - Conf2 - seemed to be optimised for marketing metrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a rehash of advice I regularly give undergraduate students at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uts.edu.au&#34;&gt;UTS&lt;/a&gt; when they ask me what certification they should get.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
